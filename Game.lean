Title "The Pumping Lemma Game"
Introduction
"
Welcome to the Pumping Lemma Game!

In this game, we build a definition of a language in terms of formal languages. For this language,
we prove various facts about appending two words or concating a character to a word, etc.
These lemmas are then used to build the Pumping Lemma for regular languages.
Finally, this Pumping Lemma is applied to some languages to show that those languages are not regular.

This game should help you to dig deep into the definition of the Pumping Lemma. It should help you
to understand the Pumping Lemma better by deriving several facts you might not think of when writing
the proof on paper.

Good luck and enjoy learning about the Pumping Lemma!
